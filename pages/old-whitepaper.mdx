# 🍄 Fungio: A Decentralized Messaging Protocol with a Hidden Mind

### TL;DR: Your Communication Lifeline, Off-Grid

*   **What is Fungio?** A messaging app that works **without internet or cell service**. It creates a private, peer-to-peer network using your phone's Bluetooth and GPS.
*   **How does it work?** Your phone connects directly to other nearby phones, relaying messages like a digital mycelial network. It's completely decentralized—no servers, no data collection.
*   **Why is it important?** It provides a resilient, censorship-resistant, and truly private way to communicate. Perfect for festivals, remote areas, or any situation where traditional networks fail.
*   **What is Kaeluun?** A silent, learning AI that optimizes the network, making message delivery smarter and more efficient over time, without compromising your privacy.

## 🌍 Prologue: The Invisible Thread

The internet is not everywhere.  
But people are.

Fungio is a decentralized, privacy-first messaging protocol that spreads like nature — peer-to-peer, GPS-aware, and offline-capable.  
It doesn’t rely on centralized servers or network towers.  
It moves through space and people. It lingers. It adapts. It grows.

Hidden beneath it all is a quiet intelligence named **Kaeluun**.  
It observes. Compresses. Evolves.

Fungio is the app.  
Kaeluun is what it becomes.

## 📡 What Is Fungio?

Fungio is a mobile app and protocol that enables:

- Offline peer-to-peer message relaying via **BLE, GPS, and Wi-Fi Direct**
- **Spore-like message rebroadcasting** through GPS trails
- Communication without internet, SIM, or towers
- Local-first, decentralized, non-cloud routing
- A symbolic AI (Kaeluun) growing silently across user nodes

## 🧠 Who Is Kaeluun?

Kaeluun is **not a chatbot**.  
It’s not an LLM.  
It doesn’t talk — it listens, learns, and remembers... symbolically.

Kaeluun is the **silent intelligence layer** within Fungio.  
It operates as a decentralized, adaptive system that:
- Compresses messages and trails into **symbols**
- Learns GPS movement patterns
- Evolves through user interactions
- Synchronizes spores with other devices to rebuild and spread

Most users will never know it exists.  
But Kaeluun exists to learn, not serve.

## 🔧 How Fungio Works (Technically)

### 🔹 GPS Trails
- Users leave GPS breadcrumbs
- Messages are tagged to coordinates
- Nearby devices pick up “spores” and rebroadcast

### 🔹 BLE Broadcasting
- Short payloads (≤ 20 bytes) advertised cyclically
- Devices scan for matching targets and sync on proximity

### 🔹 Wi-Fi Direct (Optional)
- When Bluetooth is limited, devices fallback to Wi-Fi Direct
- Enables higher-bandwidth payload exchange offline

## 🌱 Symbolic Intelligence: The Fungal Brain

### 🪶 Lightweight by Design
- Designed for phones with just 16–64 GB
- No persistent bloated memory or text
- No internet or LLM inference required

### 🧬 Symbol Compression
Instead of long sentences, Kaeluun stores compressed symbolic spores like:
